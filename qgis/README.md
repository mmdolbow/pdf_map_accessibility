# QGIS Folder
Contains:
1. example1.qgz - QGIS Project file used to create the initial PDF
2. export_options.png - screen grab of the PDF export options used to create the initial PDF
3. PDFs demonstrating accessibility options

## Untagged PDF
"region_example_untagged.pdf" is the PDF file exported directly from QGIS, with no alterations made. It can be used to test other techniques listed here.

## Tagged PDF
"region_example_tagged.pdf" is the result of tagging via the technique described in [Tagging Maps with Acrobat Professional](https://mn.gov/mnit/assets/map-tagging-acrobat-professional_tcm38-382613.pdf) (see page 3). You can see that an H1 and a Figure tag have been created, and they are not empty. Alt text has been assigned to the map as a Figure tag. Activating Read Out Loud will read the tags for both items (the text for the H1 tag was automatically created)
