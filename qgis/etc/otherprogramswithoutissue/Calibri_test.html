        Test of Calibri Ligature Problem in Adobe

        <p>
            This paragraph and the title above were typed into MS Visual Studio Code. The Calibri font was applied with CSS.
            We are testing if words like "matter" and "intention" break on 
            encoding within a PDF after tagging as text/paragraph (if necessary) and running the Full Accessibility Check in Acrobat Pro.
